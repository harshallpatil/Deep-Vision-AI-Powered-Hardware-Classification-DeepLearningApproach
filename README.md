# PC_Part-Data-Classification

**Project Overview:**

_This project involves building and testing image classification models to identify PC parts from a dataset of images collected from Google Images. With 14 categories and a total of 3,279 images, the project aims to train deep learning models using well-known architecturet. By exploring techniques like transfer learning and data augmentation, the goal is to improve the accuracy of PC part classification.The ultimate goal is to provide a benchmark dataset for evaluating image classification techniques in the domain of PC hardware recognition._
